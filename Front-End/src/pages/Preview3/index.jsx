          The Maze Runner is a 2014 American dystopian science fiction film
          directed by Wes Ball, in his directorial debut, based on James
          Dashner's 2009 novel of the same name. The film is the first
          installment in The Maze Runner film series and was produced by Ellen
          Goldsmith-Vein, Wyck Godfrey, Marty Bowen, and Lee Stollman with a
          screenplay by Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers, and T.S. Nowlin. The
          film stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Aml Ameen, Thomas
          Brodie-Sangster, Ki Hong Lee, Will Poulter, and Patricia Clarkson. The
          story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas, portrayed by O'Brien, who
          awakens in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn
          that he has been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along
          with many other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of
          the ever-changing labyrinth – all while establishing a functioning
          society in what they call the Glade. Development of The Maze Runner
          began in January 2011 when Fox purchased the film rights to Dashner's
          novel with Gotham Group, Temple Hill Entertainment, TSG Entertainment
          as producers and Catherine Hardwicke intended to direct. In 2012, Ball
          was hired to direct the film adaptation after presenting a 3D
          computer-animated short film titled Ruin with a similar tone and was
          initially considered for a feature-length adaptation. Principal
          photography began in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on May 13, 2013, and
          officially concluded on July 12, 2013. The Maze Runner was released on
          September 19, 2014, in the United States by 20th Century Fox. The film
          received positive reviews, with praise for the performances and tone.
          Critics considered it to be better than most young adult book-to-film
          adaptations. The film was first at the box office in its opening
          weekend, grossing $32.5 million, making it the
          seventh-highest-grossing debut in September. The film earned over $348
          million worldwide at the box office, against its budget of $34
          million. A sequel, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, was released on
          September 18, 2015, in the United States. A third and final film, Maze
          Runner: The Death Cure, was released on January 26, 2018. Plot A
          teenage boy wakes up inside an underground elevator with no memory of
          his identity, and greeted by several male youths in a large grass
          area, called the "Glade," enclosed by tall stone walls. The "Gladers"
          have formed a rudimentary society, and each assumes specialized tasks.
          The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them is the only way out.
          During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route
          and return before nightfall when the entrance closes. After a
          competitive fight with Gally, the boy remembers his name is Thomas.
          The next day, he is attacked by Ben, a Runner who has been stung and
          left delirious by a Griever, one of the techno-organic creatures that
          roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die as
          a direct consequence of his actions, along with there being no cure
          for his condition. Alby, the leader, and Minho, the lead Runner, later
          retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze the following morning. Minho
          reappears late in the afternoon dragging Alby, who has been stung, but
          are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas runs into the
          Maze to help, which leaves all three trapped. Thomas lures a Griever
          into a closing passageway, which causes it to be crushed. The three
          manage to survive the night and return the next morning. A girl
          arrives in the elevator, with a note saying that she is the last one
          to enter the Glade, and recognizes Thomas, but he cannot remember her.
          Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze, locate the
          Griever corpse, and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it.
          Gally claims that Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the
          Gladers and the Grievers, and wants him punished. However, Newt, the
          group's second-in-command, instead designates Thomas as a Runner.
          Minho shows Thomas a hand-constructed model of the Maze that is based
          on previous explorations. The Maze's numbered sections open and close
          in a regular sequence and Thomas realizes that the device corresponds
          to a section of the Maze. The girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled
          with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he recovers from
          the Griever sting. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze with
          the device and discover a possible exit. Several traps are activated,
          forcing Thomas and Minho to leave. That night, the Maze entrance does
          not close, and others open, allowing the Grievers to enter. Alby,
          Zart, Clint, and several others die and Gally blames Thomas for the
          events. Thomas, who has been having disconnected memory flashes since
          his arrival, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an
          attempt to revive his memory before he is injected with the last
          anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the
          organization that created the Maze, WCKD, and the boys unknowingly
          have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and
          confesses that he and Teresa worked with WCKD and studied the boys for
          years. Meanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice
          Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore peace. However, several
          Gladers free them and enter the Maze, but Gally and a few others
          refuse to leave. As they attempt to access a possible exit, Jeff and
          several other Gladers are killed by Grievers. The Gladers eventually
          enter a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, Ava
          Paige, a WCKD official, explains that the planet has been devastated
          by a massive solar flare, followed by a pandemic of a deadly virus,
          the Flare. The group learns that they were part of an experiment
          intended to develop a cure. Paige is seen shooting herself in the
          video as the lab is overtaken by armed men. Gally, having been stung
          by a Griever, appears, insists that they will never be free, and
          points a gun at Thomas. Minho impales Gally in the chest with a spear,
          but he fatally shoots Chuck. While Thomas mourns over Chuck, masked
          armed men then rush in and take the group to a helicopter. It flies
          over a vast desert wasteland and approaches a ruined city. Later, the
          supposedly dead scientists meet in a room. Paige notes that the
          experiment has been successful and the survivors are now entering
          Phase Two.
